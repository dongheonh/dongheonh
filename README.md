### Hello World ðŸ‘‹

My fascination with robotics took root during a project at Georgia Tech. Our team was focused on creating a humanoid robot that could replicate movements akin to humans. It was during this endeavor that I became aware of the challenges traditional, rigid robots face in executing fluid and intricate motions. This led me to the field of soft robotics, which promises a closer resemblance to human-like movement, particularly in terms of achieving nuanced and adaptable motions.

Looking ahead, my primary research objective is to improve the control effectiveness of continuum robots. This involves not only advancing the sensory features of soft robots but also developing a comprehensive mathematical model to accurately describe their kinematic behavior.
